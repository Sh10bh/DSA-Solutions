## Easy
A cafe has n computers. The customer events are represented by a string s of uppercase English letters, where each distinct letter appears exactly twice:

The first occurrence denotes the customer's arrival.
The second occurrence denotes the customer's departure.

A customer is assigned a computer only if one is available at the time of arrival, otherwise the customer is rejected and does not use a computer.
Return the number of customers who could not be assigned a computer upon arrival.
Examples:
Input: n = 3, s = "GACCBDDBAGEE"
Output: 1
Explanation: Only D will not be able to get any computer. So the answer is 1.
Input: n = 1, s = "ABCBAC"
Output: 2
Explanation: B and C will not be able to get any computers. So the answer is 2.
Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 261 ≤ |s| ≤ 52s consists of uppercase English letters and each letter occurs exactly 2 times.
